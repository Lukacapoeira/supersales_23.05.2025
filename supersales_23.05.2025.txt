-- 1️⃣ Step: Aggregate quantity sold per product in discounted orders
WITH sum_table AS (
  SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    pg.category,
    SUM(op.item_quantity) AS sum_quantity
  FROM product_groups pg 
  LEFT JOIN products p ON pg.group_id = p.group_id
  LEFT JOIN order_positions op ON op.product_id = p.product_id
  WHERE op.position_discount > 0
  GROUP BY p.product_id, pg.category
),

-- 2️⃣ Step: Calculate the percentage share of each product within its category
percent_table AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    ROUND(
      sum_quantity * 100.0 / SUM(sum_quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY category),
      3
    ) AS percent_share
  FROM sum_table
),

-- 3️⃣ Step: Rank products within each category by their percentage share
ranked_table AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY category 
      ORDER BY percent_share DESC
    ) AS ranked
  FROM percent_table
)

-- 4️⃣ Final selection: Top 3 products per category based on share
SELECT *
FROM ranked_table 
WHERE ranked <= 3
ORDER BY category, ranked;
